          <p id="displayl">I love to take photos of different scenery types. Below shows some of my best photos taken in Europe. I hope to continue my passion for photography in college and my future career.</p>

          <p id="displayr"><span id="green">VOLUNTEERING</span></p>
          <p id="displayr">Throughout high school, I volunteered a total of 500+ hours. I love to help different kinds of people, and learn more about their experiences, which is why I volunteer so much. I hope to volunteer many more hours of my time in the future to help other individuals. Check out my <a href="resume.html" id="blue">resume</a> to learn more about my volunteering and club experiences!</p>

          <p id="displayr"><span id="green">PIANO</span></p>
          <p id="displayr">Piano makes me more motivated and allows me to create new ideas. I'm not the best at piano, but it is a passion of mine, and I have also created a simple motivational song. Below you can hear the audio to my song, hope you enjoy!</p>

        <section id="transbox">
          <p id="displayr"><span id="green">CYBER SECURITY</span></p>
          <p id="displayr">I started competing in Cyber Security competitions in the 8th grade. From then on I fell in love with it. I compete in CyberPatriots with a team of 6, and in National Cyber League, individually. In Cyberpatriots, we find vulnerabilities in different machines (Linux and Windows), and fix them. I am also trying to work towards the CEH certificate, so I can grasp a better understanding of security (National Cyber League has helped me towards this certificate). My goal in the future is to be a bug bounty hunter, so I can help companies make sure black hat hackers don't break through their websites.</p>

        <section id="transbox">
          <p id="displayr"><span id="green">PROGRAMMING</span></p>
          <p id="displayr">I started coding when I was 13 and from then on I really enjoyed it. I mostly program in python because I like Data Analysis and OpenCV. My most proud project is a facial detection, motion detection, and object finder all in one. I have also created about 30 python codes in my two years of learning. When I graduate I would like to go into a field involving cybersecurity and computer science.</p>
