          <p id="displayr">Throughout high school and college, I volunteered a total of 500+ hours. I love to help different individuals, and learn more about their experiences, which is why I volunteer so much. I hope to volunteer many more hours of my time in the future to help other individuals. Check out my <a href="resume.html" id="blue">resume</a> to learn more about my volunteering and club experiences!</p>

          <p id="displayr"><span id="green">PIANO</span></p>
          <p id="displayr">Playing the piano allows me to listen and meditate with the song I am playing, which helps me focus. I'm not the best at piano, but it is a passion of mine. I have also created a simple motivational song. Below you can hear the audio to my song (Angels Never Die), hope you enjoy!</p>

          <p id="displayr"><span id="green">CYBER SECURITY</span></p>
          <p id="displayr">I started competing in Cyber Security competitions in the 8th grade. From then on I fell in love with computers. I have done many competitions throughout my career, such as Cyber Patriots, National Cyber League, and Cyber Secuirty Club. I am also trying to work towards the CEH certificate, so I can grasp a better understanding of security (Different CTF competitions have helped me towards this certificate). My goal in the future is to be a bug bounty hunter, so I can help companies make sure black hat hackers can't break through their websites. Check out my <a href="resume.html" id="blue">resume</a> to learn more about my cyber security experiences!</p>

          <p id="displayr"><span id="green">PROGRAMMING</span></p>
          <p id="displayr">I started coding when I was 13 and it showed me how easy it is to take a handheld device and just make something useful. After entering college, I have basic to intermediate knowledge in Python, Java, and C++. In high school, I created about 30 different python games. In college, I created a game and a robot in C++, and took a Java class. All of these codes are backed up, which you can check out on my <a href="https://github.com/shahvraj26" id="blue">github!</a> When I graduate I would like to go into a field involving cybersecurity and computer science.</p>
