      <h1>Best Laptop for Students!</h1>
      <h3>February 2021</h2>
      <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-14-gaming-laptop-amd-ryzen-9-16gb-memory-nvidia-geforce-rtx-2060-max-q-1tb-ssd-moonlight-white/6403816.p?skuId=6403816" target="_blank"><img src="images/laptop.png"></a>
      <p>Laptops are a necessity now in college. We need a lightweight, portable, and powerful laptop within our budget. It may be hard for many people to find the perfect laptop that can last them 4+ years. Because of this hardship with many people, I went on a quest to find a laptop that will meet everyone’s needs under $1,200.</p>

      <p>From January, I needed a new laptop, as my old laptop was slowing down, and I could not get much work done on it. The new laptop I was going to get had to meet my requirements. Portability for college, good graphics for video editing and gaming, a fast processor for me to run my virtual machines and code, a good battery to last me till the end of the day in college, and a nice and comfortable keyboard to type better essays, and of course my blogs! All these requirements seemed impossible to find for a laptop under $1,200.</p>
     
      <p>I started researching different websites, articles, and YouTube videos. It took me about two months, but I finally found a laptop that went beyond my requirements and was $1,200. It was called the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14. This laptop is one of a kind with an AMD Ryzen 9 4900HS, Nvidia Geforce RTX 2060 Max-Q, 1 TeraByte of Storage, and 16 GigaBytes of Ram. All of these specs make this laptop a productivity/gaming powerhouse. This laptop also has a 1080p display with a 144 Hertz Refresh Rate. It is also very light, about 0.5 pounds heavier than a MacBook Pro. With a 14-inch display, 3.9-pound laptop, you can carry this in a backpack with ease. It also plays various games with great FPS, which is good if you want to take a break from work, and relax. You can also take this to professional meetings, and it will look like a normal laptop.</p>

        <p id="green">Some pros of this laptop:</p>

        <p>- Doesn’t have a webcam (You can just buy an external one easily)</p>
        <p>- The keyboard backlighting is terrible</p>
        <p>- Does not have an RJ-45 jack (For faster Internet Speed)</p>

      <p>I believe the Pros outweigh the Cons significantly. The Con’s are mostly cosmetic issues. This laptop is amazing for college students. I got my G14 on a deal in Best Buy for $1,199. Having this laptop for a week now feels amazing. I did have some issues with the VirtualBox images not booting up, but with VMware, it works flawlessly, so if you prefer Virtualbox over VMware it may  be a problem (not a big one tho, VMware does more things.)</p>

      <p>Hopefully, you enjoyed my review of the Asus G14, and hopefully, all of you will buy one! If you have any questions about this laptop you can email me at <a href="mailto:shahvraj26@gmail.com" id="blue">shahvraj26@gmail.com.</a></p>
